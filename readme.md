# Nvim config

This is my personal nvim config, originally it was based on theprimeagen's
config, but I will change it as I use it. 

## Getting started

This config has two main dependencies that are not commonly installed 
out-of-the-box on linux npm and packer. Install npm through your distro's 
package manager, and install packer with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

For grep support, make sure to install [ripgrep](https://github.com/burntSushi/ripgrep)

```bash
sudo apt install ripgrep
```
